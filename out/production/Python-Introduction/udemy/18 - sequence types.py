"""
Basic sequence types - list, tuple, range

Also binary data and text strings
Sequence - ordered collection of items.

Iterables - anything you can iterate over
Indexing starts from zero

All sequences can be iterated over.
Not all iterables are sequences.

STRINGS - immutable (can't be changed)

LISTS - mutable (can be changed)

IMMUTABLE:
Can't be changed. When we try to change it, Python creates a new object and re-attaches the name to it
int float bool str touple frozenset byte

MUTABLE:
Can be changed. When new item is appended, Python is able to change the contents without creating a new object.
list dict set Bytearray
